//! Exact integer geometry predicates shared by clipping, ring orientation, and point-in-ring tests.
//!
//! Every predicate is exact across the full `i32` coordinate range and never panics (no floats, no
//! division). A 2-D cross product of full-`i32` points can reach `2^65`, so exactness needs 128-bit
//! arithmetic *somewhere*; following [`i_overlay`]/`i_float` — which widen `i32 → i64` and
//! cross-multiply the edge *difference* vectors within a bounded coordinate domain — [`orient`]
//! evaluates the cross in `i64` on the difference vectors and only widens to `i128` when a difference
//! does not fit `i32` (the rare near-full-`i32`-span case). Ordinary tile-local geometry therefore
//! never pays the 128-bit width, while the crate keeps its full-`i32` contract.
