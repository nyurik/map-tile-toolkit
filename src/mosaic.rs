//! Stateful reassembly of sliced tiles back into whole features — the accumulating inverse of the
//! slicers.
//!
//! [`Mosaic`] rejoins **polyline** tiles ([`SlicerAll`](crate::SlicerAll)); [`PolygonMosaic`] rejoins
//! **polygon** tiles ([`PolygonSlicerOne`](crate::PolygonSlicerOne)). Both take each tile's geometry
//! in its local frame, rebase it into the global frame (`local + tile·extent`), and link geometry
//! across borders by shared **directed edges**. [`add`](Mosaic::add) rejects a tile inconsistent with
//! those already present — naming the ones it conflicts with, and leaving the mosaic unchanged — in
//! two ways:
//!
//! - **Payload:** slicing duplicates a border-crossing segment identically (position **and** payload)
//!   in every tile that carries it, so a shared edge whose vertices *disagree* is a conflict. (A single
//!   position may be shared by several features — edges only collide when their whole segment does — so
//!   unrelated features meeting at a point never conflict.)
//! - **Membership:** every tile is complete in its own *core* (the cell it owns), so an edge with an
//!   endpoint in a present tile's core must be carried by that tile. A present tile that owns an
//!   endpoint but lacks the edge — a line spanning into a neighbor the neighbor never corroborates,
//!   or two tiles disagreeing at a shared junction — is a conflict. A buffer only widens the overlap
//!   two tiles share, and the whole overlap must match; any *disagreement* there surfaces here too,
//!   because the differing vertex lands in some tile's core. Only a pure *omission* of redundant
//!   overlap geometry goes unflagged — and that is harmless, since the core tile still supplies the
//!   edge and duplicates collapse on reassembly.
//!
//! [`iter_features`](Mosaic::iter_features) re-chains the distinct edges into maximal chains
//! (`stitch`) — the same reconstruction a from-scratch merge of all tiles would produce.
//!
//! The two mosaics differ only in how a tile's input becomes directed edges:
//!
//! - [`Mosaic`] uses every consecutive vertex pair of each **run**. It needs only the `extent`.
//! - [`PolygonMosaic`] takes each tile's **rings** and keeps only the edges that **touch** the tile's
//!   buffered box `B` (design doc §7). This drops all the slicer's synthetic geometry — the
//!   clip-boundary corners, fill boxes, and gap-bridging chords, which are routed strictly *outside*
//!   `B` — while every real ring edge survives in the tile that owns its start vertex (whose cell lies
//!   in `B`, so the edge touches `B` there). The *same* edge machinery then reassembles the rings, with
//!   orientation and holes falling out of the directed edges. Testing the edge rather than the vertex
//!   is what catches a bridge chord drawn directly between two *original* crossing vertices, which no
//!   per-vertex tag could. Because it re-derives `B`, it needs the `buffer` as well as the `extent`. A
//!   tile lying entirely inside a polygon (an all-synthetic fill) contributes no edges — correct, since
//!   a reassembled polygon's interior is implied by its winding, not by fill tiles.
