//! The [`Vertex`] abstraction: what the slicer needs from a polyline vertex.
//!
//! The slicer keeps **original** vertices — it never cuts new ones at a tile edge — so a vertex's
//! payload (an M / measure value, an id, anything `Copy + PartialEq`) rides through slicing unchanged, with
//! no interpolation. A vertex therefore only has to expose its integer position for the clipping and
//! tiling math and be able to produce a copy at a shifted position (for tile-local re-framing).
//!
//! [`Coord<i32>`] implements [`Vertex`] (the position *is* the whole vertex), so the
//! `Geometry<i32>` API keeps working. [`Measured`] pairs a position with an arbitrary payload for
//! callers that need M values, which `geo-types` cannot represent.
