//! Bad-data tests for [`Mosaic`]: hand-crafted **inconsistent** tile sets that a real slicer could
//! never produce, which the mosaic must reject with [`TileError::Conflict`].
//!
//! Each `tests/bad-fixtures/*.geojson` is a `FeatureCollection` whose features carry a
//! `"role": "tile x/y"` property naming the tile that (supposedly) contributed them, in global
//! coordinates (extent [`EXTENT`]); several features may share a tile. Every fixture is loaded,
//! grouped by tile, and — for **every** insertion order — fed to a fresh mosaic; some `add` must
//! return a `Conflict` (order-independent detection), and the failing `add` must leave the mosaic
//! unchanged (atomicity).
//!
//! The inconsistencies exercised (see the fixtures): a feature spanning into a neighbor that never
//! corroborates it, two tiles disagreeing on a shared edge's far endpoint, on both endpoints, on its
//! direction, a middle tile missing the segments that pass through its core, and — from a buffered
//! slice — a tile whose boundary-crossing edge is correct but a *further* overlap vertex is moved
//! (the moved vertex lands in some tile's core, so the core-completeness check rejects it without the
//! mosaic ever needing the buffer).
